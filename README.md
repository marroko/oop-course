# oop-course
Each lab had an imposed `main()` with task description in Polish (except for <i>lab05</i>). <br>
I must have written own <i>.cpp</i> and <i>.h</i>  files in order to compile whole project and prevent it from memory leaks. <br>
Any help options like <i> C++ documentation</i> or <i>hint syntax</i> <b>were strictly forbidden.</b> <br>
First term ended on <i>lab15</i>, next one will come soon...

#### Currently I'm going to have second part of course.
