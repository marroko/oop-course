# oop-course
Each lab had an imposed `main()` with task description in Polish (except for <i>1st term/lab05</i>). <br>
I must have written own <i>.cpp</i> and <i>.h</i>  files in order to compile whole project, solve the problem and prevent program from memory leaks. <br>
Any help options like <i> C++ documentation</i> or <i>hint syntax</i> <b>were strictly forbidden.</b> <br>
###### UPDATES
Finished lab files appear in repo as soon as possible. They are divided into directories representing the terms.

#### Currently I'm learning C++ during second term of course.
